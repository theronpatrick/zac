## Installation
Make sure you have node.js installed on your machine. Run `npm install` to install dependencies. 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

You can then run the app from any static server, like:
```
npm install -g pushstate-server
pushstate-server build
start http://localhost:9000
```
